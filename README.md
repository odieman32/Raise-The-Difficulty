# 🎮 Raise The Difficulty – Unity Project

Welcome to the **Adaptive Difficulty Game**, a 2D action game built in Unity designed to showcase a scalable difficulty system that adapts based on player performance. This project highlights gameplay progression, player upgrades, and challenging enemies culminating in a final boss fight.

---

## 🚀 Game Concept

The objective is simple: **climb through increasing levels of difficulty** until you defeat the final boss — but there's a twist. Each difficulty level has **specific criteria** you must meet to advance, such as:

- Surviving for a certain amount of time
- Taking minimal hits

As you progress through each level, you'll also have the opportunity to **upgrade your character's stats**, adding a layer of strategy to how you play.

**Good luck, and have fun!**
