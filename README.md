This project is to be used in unity and it is to show off an adpative difficulty system.
The objective of the game is to raise the difficulty of the game until you get to the hardest difficulty and defeat the boss. 
Once the boss is defeated you win, but there is a catch.
Each difficulty has criteria you must meet in order to go up in difficulty.
This could consist of number if hits on the player or a time limit. 
Each level you will be able to upgrade a stat on your character.
Good luck and have fun!

Controls:

Old Development: 
MVP Developement

Currently the MVP includes a temporary wave spawner, UI for hit count and UI for stamina bar (does not work yet), a moving character with an attack and dash, and enemies that spawn.
Also, I have a main menu screen and terrain laid out for the character. 
I am working to make the dash a little better and figuring out a way to make a point-based spawner. This will allow for player performance to be the key aspect of the game.
I have learned a lot about 2D development, spawners and over all game design of characters. I am still learning and look forward to how this project will turn out. 
Through feedback, I will be actively looking to make characters stop moving when hit and make the dashes feel better. Also, there will be added audio to the game later. 
The terrain will change for later to make the spawning locations better. I will add different enemy types to the game for variety as well.
